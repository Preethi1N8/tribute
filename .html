      <h2>Peacock</h2>
      <p>
     One of the most interesting things to know about the peacock bird is that they tend to have a
     very beautiful looking tail that is decorated with more than 200 different feathers that tend to 
     shimmer when they are fluttered open. These feathers are individually decorated in a beautiful manner with some
     eyespots. The colors of the male peacock are iridescent and are decked in greens and blues over the head, breast, and neck. 
     This provides a very unique look to the peacock and hence the bird gets its very attractive quality.
     The tail of the peacock is known as the “Tail”. This tail is not really composed of the tail feathers that are made 
     into quills but they are mostly of the elongated tail feathers that are from the upper part of their bodies. 
     There is no doubt that this bird is absolutely stunning to look at and hence is a popular attraction.
     The train of the bird is pretty much bronze in color with slight patches of green.

     There are eyes in individual feathers that tend to become even more prominent and obvious when they fan their tails during the courting or the dancing time. For students who need to know Peacock facts, 
     there is no doubt that these notes would definitely be able to help them out in the best way.

     Peacocks like living in the world and they mostly have their habitats in forested locations. Apart from that, these birds also have their prime locations on agricultural lands and farms as well. These birds also make sure that are situated in the lowland forests which are both tropical. Another one of the places that they have their location is the deciduous forests and the dry habitats too. Even though the peacocks tend to be in their natural ranges, they tend to roam around in different cities and parks. 
     They do so in the search of several food materials.
     <p>
     The male tends to spread the train of feathers that it has and flutters it to gather the attraction of the females.
     The males tend to back down towards the females that are receptive and then swing around in order to confront them with the magnificence of their display. After the performance of the display, the males crow out in a large voice in order to impress the females. If one is pleased, then she will turn to join the harem of peahens that the male already has. The peacock is more commonly polygamous in nature.
